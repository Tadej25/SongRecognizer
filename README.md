# SongRecognizer
A simple python application that finds the metadata of song files

To get your API token you have to signup on this website: https://dashboard.audd.io/ and you have 300 song requests for free.

The only dependencies you have to install is the eyed3, installed through pip: pip install eyed3

!NOTICE!

When you're installing the eyed3 dependency be sure to keep the d lower case since if you use eyeD3 will not work.

When you want to use the app be shure to put your songs into the "songs" folder

Enjoy
